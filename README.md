# boomlang
A programming language that will not blow you up

It's called boomlang, not boom, this ain't Go. It's named after the [boomslang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomslang), a snake endemic to southern Africa and commonly found in South Africa.
The name is Afrikaans/Dutch for "tree snake"; boom meaning tree, and slang meaning snake. Snakes and animals are cool, so [check out the WWF, and donate even just a little to make a difference.](https://donate.wwf.org.za/)
